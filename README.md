### Expected Value

Using the properties of expected value, the expected value of the sum $`\(N\bar{X}\)`$ is \(N\) times the average of the urn, \(p\). Dividing by the non-random constant \(N\) gives us the expected value of the average \(\bar{X}\):

\[ E(\bar{X}) = p \]

### Standard Error

We can also determine the standard error. The standard error of the sum is \(\sqrt{N} \times\) the standard deviation of the urn. The formula for the standard deviation of the urn is:

\[ \sqrt{p(1 - p)} \]

Since we are dividing the sum by \(N\), the standard error of the average \(\bar{X}\) is:

\[ SE(\bar{X}) = \frac{\sqrt{p(1 - p)}}{\sqrt{N}} \]
